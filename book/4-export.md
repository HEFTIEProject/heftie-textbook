# Exporting

In this chapter we'll look at how to convert sub-volumes of 3D Zarr images to other file formats.
The use case for this is allow users to extract sub-volumes of large 3D images into a preferred file format, perform some analysis/processing on the sub-volume using their preferred tools and then copy the results back in-place to the original Zarr image.

Note: This process is more complex for OME-Zarr images that have a series of different resolution levels.
When writing the processed sub-volume back to the OME-Zarr image, you will need to ensure that the resolution levels are updated correctly.

## Converting Zarr sub-volumes to TIFF

To begin this chapter, we'll look at how to convert Zarr sub-volumes to TIFF.

To start with we'll load our heart sample dataset, as a Zarr array and then extract a smaller volume as a NumPy array.

Note: the heart sample dataset is only 200MB, so the entire dataset could be extracted into a NumPy array (and therefore loaded into memory) if required.
If you are working with larger datasets, you will need to keep the extracted volume small enough to fit into memory, or extract it as a series of smaller chunks.
If you are using an in-memory Zarr store, then the entire dataset will be loaded into memory regardless of the size of the sub-volume you extract.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pathlib import Path
import zarr
import numpy as np

from data_helpers import load_heart_data, plot_slice

zarr_array = load_heart_data(array_type="zarr")

n_bytes = zarr_array.nbytes
n_mb = n_bytes / (10**6)

print(f"Zarr array store: {zarr_array.store}")
print(f"Zarr array shape: {zarr_array.shape}")
print(f"Zarr array dtype: {zarr_array.dtype}")
print(f"Zarr array chunks: {zarr_array.chunks}")
print(f"Zarr array size: {n_mb:.3f} MB")

```

The output above shows that we have created a Zarr array object, but importantly, the data itself has not been loaded into memory yet.
The store information tells us that the data is stored in a Zarr storage backend - with each chunk stored as a separate file on disk rather than in memory.
This lazy loading approach is one of the key advantages of Zarr - you can work with arrays much larger than your available RAM.

Now let's extract a small sub-volume from the Zarr array. This operation will only load the requested slice into memory as a NumPy array, leaving the rest of the data untouched:

```{code-cell} ipython3
start_idx = 40
end_idx = 50
slice_range = slice(start_idx, end_idx)
np_array = zarr_array[slice_range, slice_range, slice_range]
n_bytes = np_array.nbytes
n_mb = n_bytes / (10**6)
print(f"Extracted sub-volume array shape: {np_array.shape}")
print(f"Extracted array dtype: {np_array.dtype}")
print(f"Extracted sub-volume size: {n_mb:.3f} MB")
```

The next step is to write this NumPy array to a TIFF file.
We would use the `imageio` library to do this, but for this tutorial we won't actually write the file to disk.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import imageio.v3 as iio
# iio.imwrite("image_file.tiff", np_array, plugin='tifffile')
zarr_small = np_array

```

Some processing can be done on the sub-volume , for example using `Fiji` or any other tool that can read and write TIFF files.
For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll fake some processing by creating a sub_array of the same shape as the original sub-volume, but filled with zeros.
The `imageio` library can be used to then read the TIFF file back into a NumPy array.
This subvolume array can then be copied back in place to the original Zarr array.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Loading the result back into a NumPy array if processed with another tool:
# sub_array = iio.imread("image_file.tiff", plugin='tifffile')

# This simulates a processed sub-volume
sub_array = zarr.zeros_like(zarr_small)


original_array = zarr_array[:, :, :]  # full NumPy array for inserting non-processed sub-volume
changed_array = zarr_array[:, :, :]  # full NumPy array for inserting processed sub-volume

original_array[40:50, 40:50, 40:50]=zarr_small # Insert non-processed data
changed_array[slice_range, slice_range, slice_range] = sub_array  # Insert processed data


```

To compare the original and processed sub-volumes being inserted back into the image, we can visualize them side by side.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from data_helpers import plot_slice

plot_slice(original_array, z_idx=45)
plot_slice(changed_array, z_idx=45)
```

## Conversion Format Comparison

The following table summarizes some other commonly used filed formats that have Python tools available for saving NumPy arrays to:
