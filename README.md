## Contributing

This book is built using [Jupyter Book](https://next.jupyterbook.org/).
To build the book locally run:

```bash
cd book
jupyter book start --execute
```

This command will print a link that can be opened in a web browser to preview the book locally.

To develop the book, it's recommended to use `uv`.
Run `uv run jupyter lab` to start Jupyter, and then navigate to the `book` directory.
Then right-click on one of the chapter's `.md` files and select "Open With" > "Jupytext Notebook". 
All cells can be edited / run directly in this interface.
